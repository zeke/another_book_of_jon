It was an attempt to estimate how fast a line of cows would need to march off a cliff into a hypothetical McDonaldâ€™s meat grinder to keep a steady supply of quarter pounders on hand.

This was my favorite thing to do with my dad. Ponder something ridiculous. Propose an absurd and usually somewhat dark idea, discuss for days, estimate, research, extrapolate, calculate.

Calculations
============

edible_cow_carcass_weight = cow_weight * inedible_percentage_of_carcass # (308)

quarter_pounders_per_cow = edible_cow_carcass_weight / quarter_pounder_weight # (1232)

cows_per_restaurant_per_day = burger_sales_per_day / quarter_pounders_per_cow # (0.24)

cows_worldwide_per_day = mcdonalds_restaraunts_in_the_world * cows_per_restaurant_per_day # (7440)

cows_worldwide_per_hour = cows_worldwide_per_day / hours_in_a_day # (310)

length_of_hourlong_singlefile_line_of_cows = (cow_length + space_between_each_animal) * cows_worldwide_per_hour # (2170)

cow_speed_in_miles_per_hour = length_of_hourlong_singlefile_line_of_cows / feet_per_mile # (0.4)

edible_human_carcass_weight = human_weight * inedible_percentage_of_carcass # (212)

quarter_pounders_per_human = edible_human_carcass_weight / quarter_pounder_weight # (53)
